# bacteria  
This code is to visualize data pertaining to bacteria present in anonymized subject data in a json file. I am including the following code that implements an interactive chart (bar and bubble) based on a selected individual id.  

The repository contains that following code and is deployed to GitHub Pages:  
- index.html
- plot.js
- samples.json

The functionality implemented is as follows:  
- dropdown user_id selector that is auto-populated with ids from the json file
- window to display demographic information pertaining to the selected id
- bar chart that filters the top 10 bacteria present for the selected id
- bubble chart that pictorially shows the relative prevalance of sspecific bacteria strains for the selected id  
- gauge that shows the selectd id's wash frequency.
